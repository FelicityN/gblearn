Recently, we proposed a universal descriptor for grain boundaries that
has desirable mathematical properties, and which can be applied to
arbitrary grain boundaries. Using this descriptor, we were able to
create a feature matrix for machine learning based on the local atomic
environments present at the grain boundary. In addition to being
useful for predicting grain boundary energy and mobility, the method
also allows important atomic environments to be discovered for each of
the properties.

You can generate the Local Environment Representation for the Olmsted
dataset using the following code. It assumes that all the Olmsted
[1] dump files from LAMMPS are in `/dbs/olmsted`. We tell the
framework to store all representations in the `/gbs/olmsted`
folder.

```python
   from gblearn.gb import GrainBoundaryCollection as GBC
   olmsted = GBC("olmsted", "/dbs/olmsted", "/gbs/olmsted",
		 r"ni.p(?P<gbid>\d+).out",
                 rcut=3.25, lmax=12, nmax=12, sigma=0.5)
   olmsted.soap()
   olmsted.LER(0.0025)
```
